# Wind and Solar Capacity Factor Details

The scripts here produce figures showing the performance of the wind and solar algorithms for deriving the hourly capacity factors.

`wind_power_curve.py` produces a figure comparing the idealized power curve used in the analysis to templates defined by NREL in their Wind Power Toolkit. Find the NREL data in `NREL_data`

`solar_PV_losses_by_temp.py` produces a figure showing the panel losses as module temperature increases.

These figures are discussed in `2.1. Historical input data` and `S.10. Wind and solar capacity factor details`
