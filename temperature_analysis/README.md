# Degree day mini-analysis

See `S.11. Degree day calculations` for defined equations in the degree day analysis.

Most results are presented in the main paper in section `3.3. Weather and peak residual load` with methods discussed in section `2.4. Degree days`.

## Temperature files for CDD and HDD analysis

Files derived from MERRA-2 and are based on an equal weighting
by geographic area for the full region of each territory. (Not
using population weighting in any way.)

## Running analysis

See notebook `plot_CDD_and_HDD_scatter.ipynb`
