# Sensitivity Analysis

## Detrend load data
Detrend the historical load data, this removes leading contributions of economic growth and population change. See `detrend_load_data.ipynb`

See `S.12. Detrending electric load` in the Supplementary material

## Sensitivity results
See `S.13. Sensitivity analysis` in the Supplementary material covering
 * number of peak hours selected: `S.13.1. Sensitivity to number of peak hours selected`
 * number of years selected: `S.13.2. Sensitivity to number of years studied`
 * detrending method: `S.13.3. Sensitivity to load data detrending method`

Summary files of the previous runs are `summary_n_years.csv` and `summary_n_hours.csv`
