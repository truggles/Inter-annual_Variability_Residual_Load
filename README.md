## Structure

 * Documentation for downloading, cleaning, and detrending the historical load data in `load_data`
 * Defined shapefiles used for selecting the wind, solar, and temperature data from MERRA-2 found in `shape_files`
 * Resuling load, wind, solar, and temperature data in `data`
 * Documentation for analyzing results of the sensitivity analysis found in `sensitivity_analysis`
 * Documentation for the degree day and peak load temperature analysis found in `temperature_analysis`
 * Documentation of the demand response data and calculations found in `demand_response`
 * Documentation of the wind and solar capacity factor algorithms in `other_figs`
